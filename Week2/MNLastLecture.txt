Mason Noble - Randy Pausch's Last Lecture

I usually clock out during lectures but this man had me engaged the entire time with his witty jokes and interesting stories. I could relate to him having many childhood dreams, quite a few of them being art related, and I've already achieved one I've had since I was about ten years old: Open up commissions and amass a customer base. There were many others, like "create a webcomic" or "work on an animation". And yes, "animate for Disney" was one of them before I came to the realization that Disney kind of sucks. 

Some childhood dreams were crossed off the list for one reason or another, but most of them remain intact and waiting to be fulfilled. Pausch was an inspirational man, to be honest. He'd completed most if not all of his childhood dreams, and those he didn't complete, he learned from and gained important knowledge and experience that he could eventually use for future opportunities. 

Pausch brought up many points I'd never taken into consideration before, and now that I have, they've really resonated with me. One of the quotes I never knew I needed to hear until the moment I heard it was "when people stop criticizing you, that means they've stopped caring." Criticism can hurt, but it comes from a place of good faith from those who care for you, love you, and want to see you grow and improve.
