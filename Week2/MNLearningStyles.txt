I took the learning style quiz and it assigned me as an auditory learner, which means that I'd learn based on sound more than anything. I would say that this quiz is correct. Most of my life is audio-oriented; I can't live without music or some sort of controlled background noise. My memories are also categorized by sound, I am more prone to remembering something if it is accompanied with sound.

I do believe that there is truth to learning styles and that they affect how a person learns due to my personal reasoning above. When learning, I need sound to accompany it so I either read material out loud or use text-to-speech. Without sound, my brain doesn't retain information nearly as easily as it does with audio accompanying it.

Everybody has their own way of learning. It could be auditory, visually, or through tactile means. Each human's brain works differently from everyone else's and I believe that the key to academic success is allowing students to utilize their unique learning style. Forcing a visual learner to obtain information through sound is like forcing a fish to walk on water- it won't work.
