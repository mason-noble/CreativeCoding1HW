How to Play:
The goal of the game is to feed the snake and make it grow!
Use the arrow keys to move your snake. Guide it to the apples (red squares) so it can eat!
If your snake runs into a wall or itself, then the game will end.
Press spacebar to start the game again, but you'll have to start over feeding your snake!
