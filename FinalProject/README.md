Here I'll provide a bit of an explanation for what you are seeing. I completely glossed over the step that all of this was supposed to be in p5 until I was rather late into the project. When I noticed. I tried to convert everything over to p5 but I just got the barebones functions, and I thought I had more time for everything. So, I'm submitting both a p5 version, and a version I worked on outside of p5. I haven't had the time to draw my own assets, so that is one promise I couldn't fulfill. I also struggled figuring out how to create a 'game over' screen within the confines of p5.js and creating a stylesheet too. Still, I'm quite proud of everything I have accomplished thus far and hope it will suffice as a final project.
